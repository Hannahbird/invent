## Description

An app to be used for the management and preparation of event spaces/locations.

## User Story

AS an event coordinator, with a busy schedule
I WANT to be able to schedule events and communicate/display tasks to my service providers of what is needed to prepare the space

WHEN I navigate to the site
THEN I am presented with a login/registration screen
WHEN I click on register
THEN I can complete an initial registration for my organization
WHEN I click submit/register
THEN I am automatically logged in and see my dashboard, which contains all currently scheduled/pending events
WHEN I click on Manage Locations
THEN I can add, edit, and delete locations within my organization
WHEN I click on Manage Departments
THEN I can add, edit, and delete departments within my organization
WHEN I add a department
THEN I am presented with a sign-up code that the departments can use to register an account as a service provider
WHEN I click New Event
THEN I am presented with a form to complete fields relevant to the event, including Contact Name and Preference, location, start and end date/time, a series of checkboxes for each registered department
WHEN I click Home
THEN I return to my dashboard

AS as service provider
I WANT an easy way to see all of the prep work that is needed for the spaces I support.

WHEN I am given a sign-up code, navigate to the site, click register, click 'I have a code'
THEN I am presented with a form to enter my username and password
WHEN I click register/sign-up
THEN I am presented with a single view of the events that my department has tasks for
